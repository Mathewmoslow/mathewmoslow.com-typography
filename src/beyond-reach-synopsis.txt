In the shadow of Jamaica's colonial past, where ancestral estates whisper of old money and even older sins, Jonathan Blake watches his inheritance slip away.

A skilled nurse by day, Jonathan masks a mind haunted since his mother's tragic overdose—a death he blames on his father's cruelty. When Richard Blake disinherits his only son, the betrayal cuts deep. But when his father announces plans to transform their ancestral great house into a tacky all-inclusive resort—with the help of his young interior designer girlfriend, Anna Sutton—Jonathan's grief transforms into something far more dangerous: a meticulously plotted revenge.

When his family's library of colonial-era law books gives Jonathan the answer to his problems, and armed with his medical expertise, he sets in motion a year-long countdown.

Some inheritances are written in blood. Some justice exists beyond the reach of law.
