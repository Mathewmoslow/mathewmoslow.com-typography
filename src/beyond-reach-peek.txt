The kitchen smelled of coffee and toast and something metallic,,,a tang
of hospital disinfectant that clung to Jonathan whenever he came home
from a shift. He had set two places at the small table, the normality of
the scene almost painful in its pretense. The tablecloth was a faded
blue, dotted with stains she could not scrub out. A single hibiscus from
the bush outside sat in a jar in the center, petals already starting to
curl. She sat, appreciating his effort while dreading the performance
ahead.

"Did you sleep?" he asked, placing a small portion of scrambled eggs
before her. He held the plate with steady hands that had inserted IVs
and stitched wounds at the hospital all night. A small smear of blood
stained the cuff of his sleeve; he had not noticed it yet.

"Some," she lied, pushing the eggs with her fork. She wondered briefly
what his nights were like. She imagined him walking fluorescent
corridors, answering alarms, touching strangers with the same care he
used to tuck blankets around her shoulders. She imagined him pulling the
curtains around a dying patient, closing their eyes with fingers that
had once held hers. What weight did he carry when he watched breath
leave bodies? Did it feel the same as watching laughter leave a
marriage?

"You're working the late shift?" she asked, though she already knew.
The schedules had become a mantra she recited to reassure herself that
he would return, that the hours alone would eventually end.

"Yes. But Mrs.~Patterson from next door said she'd stop by this
afternoon." He buttered his toast with quick, efficient motions. "And
I'll be home by eleven."

Martha nodded again, cataloging the hours she would be alone. The
careful monitoring system they had established after what Jonathan
called "the incident" three months ago. Neither of them used the word
"overdose." As if language could reshape reality. As if not naming
something could rob it of its power. The memory was still sharp:
Jonathan coming home early, finding her on the bathroom floor, cold
vomit on her shirt, pill bottles upended like seeds spilled across tile.
His eyes wide, his voice cracking as he called the ambulance. The
humiliation of a neighbor watching as paramedics carried her out. The
pitying glance of the emergency nurse who had once been her bridge
partner. The taste of charcoal. She had vowed to never put him through
that again, and yet the pills remained, lined up like soldiers waiting
for orders.

Jonathan watched her take a small bite of toast, satisfaction crossing
his features when she swallowed. He didn't understand that eating had
become a performance for his benefit, like her smiles, like her promises
to call her therapist, like her assurances that she was getting better.
Chewing felt like moving pebbles in her mouth. The toast turned to paste
she could barely swallow. She forced it down and took a sip of coffee,
letting the bitterness coat her tongue, the warmth spread through her
chest like a small fire.

"I've been thinking about the garden," she said suddenly, desperate to
fill the silence with something other than fear.

Jonathan looked up, surprise animating his tired face. "The garden?"
He buttered another piece of toast, his movements slowing.

"At Blake Hall." The words tasted like roses and limestone. "The
roses will need pruning soon. January is always when we cut them back."
Her gaze drifted to the window, where potted herbs wilted on the sill.
"The white ones by the east terrace bloom so beautifully in April."
She could see them: climbing over the trellis, their petals luminous at
dusk, their scent heavy and intoxicating. She remembered mornings when
she would walk barefoot on dew‑coated grass, pruning shears in hand, the
gardener following with a wheelbarrow, and Richard calling out from the
veranda for another cup of coffee.

Jonathan's expression softened with concern. "Mom, we don't live at
Blake Hall anymore." His tone was gentle but firm, like a nurse
reminding a confused patient of the date.

"I know that," she said, too quickly. "I was just remembering."
Remembering was all she seemed capable of lately. The memories played on
endless loop,,,Richard's laugh as he toasted with local politicians, the
feel of sun‑warmed stone beneath her palm, the scent of those roses
after rain. Twenty‑seven years of life, packed away and replaced with
this small house, these white pills, this constant ache.

"I saw my father yesterday," Jonathan said carefully, watching her
reaction.

Martha kept her expression neutral though her heart quickened. "Oh?"

"At the hospital." Jonathan's eyes flicked toward the sink. "He was
touring the new pediatric wing. The one being named after his
grandfather." His voice held an edge. "He asked about you."

Martha set down her fork. The clink of metal on porcelain sounded like a
gavel. "What did you tell him?"

"That you're fine." He lifted his mug, drinking without tasting.

The lie hung between them. Richard Blake, ever the benefactor, the
respected businessman, the pillar of Kingston society, inquiring
politely about the woman he had discarded. Martha wondered if Anna had
been with him, young and beautiful Anna, with her interior design
business and her proximity to Richard's social circle. Anna, who was
everything Martha no longer was. A memory rose: the first time she saw
Anna at a charity auction, a vision in emerald silk, leaning close to
Richard with a laugh like silver bells. Martha had smiled then, not yet
understanding that this woman would replace her in both bed and
boardroom. Later, she had found Anna's perfume,,,orange blossom and
musk,,,on Richard's shirt collar, and the world had tilted.

"That was kind of you," Martha said finally, the words forced through
a tight throat.

Jonathan's face darkened. "It wasn't for his benefit." He scraped egg
remnants onto his fork with more force than necessary, the metallic
scrape loud in the small room.

Martha reached across the table and touched his hand. His skin felt warm
against her perpetually cold fingers. "Don't carry this anger,
Jonathan." Her voice softened. "It doesn't help."

"How can you defend him? After everything,,,"

"I'm not defending him." She withdrew her hand. The distance between
them felt like an ocean. "I just don't want hatred to consume you. You
have your whole life ahead." She saw Richard's stubbornness in his
clenched jaw, her own softness in the downturn of his mouth. She had
hoped her son would inherit only the best parts of each of them. Instead
he carried their worst traits like scars.

Jonathan looked away, his jaw tight. "I need to get ready for work."
He stood, clearing dishes with precise movements that reminded Martha of
Richard,,,the same controlled anger, the same rigid posture. The
similarity frightened her more than she could express.

Later, after Jonathan had left for his shift at Kingston General, the
house settled into silence. Afternoon light slanted through the windows,
dust motes dancing in golden beams. She held a book in her lap, pages
unturned for hours. The words swam when she tried to read; stories lost
their meaning. On the side table, the photo of Jonathan's graduation
remained, a frozen moment of genuine happiness in recent years. She
reached for it again, her thumb tracing her son's smile.

The phone rang, shattering the stillness. Martha stared at it, unmoving,
letting the answering machine take the call. The tape whirred, then
clicked.

"Martha, it's Richard." His voice crackled through the speaker, still
smooth, still commanding. "Jonathan mentioned you've been\ldots{} I
thought perhaps\ldots{} Well, call me if you need anything." A pause.
"Please." Static hissed before the machine beeped.

His voice still affected her, even now. Like fingers pressing against a
bruise,,,pain followed by a strange, hollow satisfaction that at least
something could still be felt. She closed her eyes, picturing his face:
the crease between his brows when he was annoyed, the way his mouth
curled when he was pleased with himself. How many times had she longed
to hear those tones saying her name? Now that they came, they were laced
with pity. She didn't reach for the phone. Instead, she reached for the
orange prescription bottle in her cardigan pocket, rolling it between
her palms as if it were a worry stone.

As the afternoon crept toward evening, shadows lengthened across the
floor, climbing the walls like vines. Martha moved to her bedroom and
carefully selected a dress from the closet,,,pale blue silk, one Richard
had once complimented. The fabric felt cool against her hand. She laid
it on the bed, smoothing invisible wrinkles. Next came pearl earrings, a
silver hairbrush, a bottle of perfume rarely used these days. She
arranged them with the same precision she'd shown the pills that
morning. A tableau of the woman she once was. She lingered over each
item, memories unfurling,,,Richard fastening the clasp of those pearls
on their wedding day, her mother brushing her hair before her first
debutante ball, the scent of jasmine that clung to her neck at the
hospital gala where she announced the opening of a new wing. Each
artifact was a thread to a life she had lost.

She sat at her vanity and began brushing her thin hair with slow,
deliberate strokes, counting silently. One hundred strokes. Her mother
had insisted it made hair shine. Martha's hair no longer shone, but the
ritual calmed her. The brush caught on a tangle, pulling gently at her
scalp. She winced and continued. In the mirror she saw not just her own
face but ghosts layered behind it: her younger self, laughing as she
danced under lanterns at Blake Hall; her son's face as a child, smeared
with mud and mango; Anna's reflection in the polished silver of a
chafing dish, eyes meeting hers across a crowded room. The weight of
those images pressed on her chest.

At the sound of Jonathan's key in the front door downstairs, she set
down the brush. She hadn't taken the pills yet, though they sat ready
beside a glass of water. Something stopped her,,,perhaps the thought of
Jonathan finding her, perhaps a final, feeble flicker of hope. She
listened as he dropped his bag, the jingle of keys, the soft thud of his
shoes on the mat.

"Mom?" His voice called from below.

"I'm here," she answered, her voice stronger than it had been all day.
She stood and reached for the pale blue dress, slipping it over her
head. The silk whispered as it fell into place, cool against her skin.
She fastened the pearls around her neck with shaking fingers and dabbed
a drop of perfume at her wrists, breathing in the floral scent that
transported her, for a moment, back to the veranda overlooking the sea.

His footsteps on the stairs, then his appearance in the doorway, still
in his scrubs. His hair was damp from a quick shower taken at the
hospital, his skin flushed from the brisk walk home. He smiled when he
saw her, a real smile that reached his eyes, softening the exhaustion
that etched lines into his brow.

"You look nice," he said, taking in the earrings, the brushed hair.
"Special occasion?" He stepped into the room, the smell of
disinfectant and coffee clinging to his clothes.

Martha smiled back, feeling tears threaten. "No.~Just felt like making
an effort." The lie was smooth, practiced. She stood a little
straighter. "Tell me about your day." She gestured toward the edge of
the bed, and he sat, the mattress dipping slightly beneath their
combined weight.

"Nothing exciting," he said, running a hand through his hair.
"Mrs.~Henderson had her twins,,,two boys. And Dr.~Phillips still can't
remember my name after three years." He laughed softly. The sound was
beautiful and painful all at once.

Martha leaned toward him, the pearls cool against her clavicle. "You've
always been invisible to certain people," she said softly. "Just like
me." She meant those words as a comfort, but they hung in the air like
an accusation.

Jonathan turned to her, his expression serious. "That's not true. You
see me. You always have." He reached out and took her hand. She studied
his long fingers,,,so like Richard's but used for such different
purposes. He squeezed gently. For a moment she imagined those fingers
administering sedation, tapping a vein, pressing gently on skin. She
blinked and looked away.

"I'm sorry," she whispered.

"For what?"

"For not being stronger." The words spilled out before she could stop
them. "For letting him break me." She squeezed his hand. "For leaving
you to pick up the pieces. For making you my nurse when you should have
been my son." Her voice broke. The tears she'd held back all day
threatened to spill.

"Mom, don't,,," He started to protest, his brow furrowing, but she cut
him off with a shake of her head.

"Let me finish." Martha's voice steadied. "I want you to know that
none of this is your fault. Not the divorce, not my\ldots{}
difficulties." She glanced at the nightstand where the pills waited.
"You've been everything a mother could want in a son." Her grip
tightened on his fingers. "You are kind, and good, and patient. You
have given more of yourself than I had any right to ask."

Jonathan studied her face, alarm growing in his eyes. "Why does this
sound like goodbye?" His voice was small, the voice of the boy who once
held her hand as they walked to the cottage on North Point, where she
told him stories about sea spirits and secret laws.

Martha forced another smile. "Don't be dramatic," she said, echoing
Richard without meaning to. "I'm just having a moment of clarity." She
released his hand and reached up to adjust a strand of hair behind his
ear. Her fingers lingered on his cheek.

Later, after Jonathan had showered and changed into a worn T‑shirt, they
sat together on the sofa watching an old movie neither really followed.
The television cast a flickering blue light across the room. Martha
leaned against his shoulder, breathing in the clean scent of him,
memorizing the warmth of his presence. A dog barked somewhere down the
street; a car door slammed; a radio played a Ska tune. Ordinary life
pressed on outside their cocoon. When Jonathan finally yawned and stood
to go to bed, she hugged him longer than usual.

"I love you," she said against his chest. The words vibrated through
him. "Remember that." She closed her eyes, memorizing the feel of his
T‑shirt beneath her cheek, the scent of soap and hospital antiseptic. It
was not a smell she loved, but it was his.

He kissed the top of her head. "Love you too. See you in the morning."
He pulled back with reluctance, his eyes searching hers for something he
could not name.

Martha watched him climb the stairs to his room. Each step seemed
heavier than the last. Then she returned to her bedroom, closed the door
softly, and moved to the vanity where the pills and water waited. She
sat on the edge of the bed and lifted the glass. The water was cool,
condensation beading on the outside. She held one pill between her thumb
and index finger, its edges firm against her skin. She held it there,
suspended, as if time might freeze and allow her to reconsider.

She didn't leave a note. What could she possibly write that Jonathan
didn't already know? That she loved him? She had said that. That she was
sorry? She had been saying it with every breath. That she could not bear
to live in a world where her home belonged to another, where her husband
kissed someone else in the ballroom she had decorated, where her own
body betrayed her? Such words felt thin. There was no poetry left in
her; only exhaustion. She thought briefly of the colonial laws she used
to read to amuse Jonathan,,,laws about a year and a day, about tides and
jurisdiction. She wondered if there were rules that governed the
afterlife, if she would stand before some judge and be asked to explain
her choice. She hoped the judge would understand weariness.

Martha raised her hand, hesitated once more, then brought the pills to
her lips. They felt chalky on her tongue. She swallowed them with a sip
of water, feeling the liquid slide down her throat and settle in her
stomach like a stone. She took more, one after another, each accompanied
by a swallow of water until the glass was empty and the row of pills had
disappeared. A sense of calm washed over her, not physical yet but
anticipatory. She lay back on the bed, arranging her arms at her sides
as if posing for a photograph. The ceiling above her was cracked and
yellowing, but in her mind she saw the coffered ceiling of Blake Hall,
saw the pale lavender drapery fluttering in a warm breeze. She heard the
distant cry of gulls and the hum of conversation from a long‑past garden
party. She smelled roses and salt and Jonathan's baby shampoo. As the
medications took hold, heaviness spread through her limbs. Her breathing
slowed. Her eyes fluttered. She thought she saw a figure in the corner
of the room,,,a young boy with dark curls and a toy boat, watching her
with solemn eyes. She tried to lift her hand to reach for him, but her
arm would not move. A warm sensation enveloped her, and the edges of the
world blurred. The last thing she felt was the brush of lips on her
forehead,,,was it her mother's, or Jonathan's in some future
moment?,,,and then nothing.

In the morning, when golden light again filtered through gauzy curtains,
it would be Jonathan who found her, still and cold on her bed, the empty
prescription bottles neatly aligned on the nightstand, her face peaceful
for the first time in years. It would be Jonathan who called the
ambulance though he knew it was too late, Jonathan who closed her eyes
with gentle fingers, Jonathan who would carry the weight of that morning
for the rest of his life. The chain of grief would link him to her as
surely as any law. Beyond the reach of justice, there was love and pain,
entwined.
