Those first weeks shimmered with possibility. I remember one evening in particular, all of us preparing dinner in our open-plan sprawling dining room. I was attempting gallo pinto from a recipe our neighbor had shared, the rice and beans somehow more complicated than they had any right to be. The focused intensity required to not burn the garlic while achieving the perfect rice texture became a meditation of sorts. Aaron moved around me in the kitchen with practiced choreography—him chopping, me stirring, our movements still holding the muscle memory of better times.

This is what life should be, I thought, watching the sunset bleed across the horizon. This is what brave looks like.

But brave and wise aren't always the same thing.

Costa Rica embraced us with a warmth we were not used to receiving in Florida. The locals treated us with patience and kindness that made me understand the word ``grace'' in a way I never had before.

Like the woman at the feria, insisting on teaching me the proper way to choose a ripe mango. ``No, no,'' she'd say, taking my hand and guiding it to the fruit. ``Feel here. Like this. When it gives just a little, like a promise.''

We were invited to family feasts where we stumbled and fumbled our way through customs and language. The burn of spicy salsa, the sweetness of tres leches, the way strangers became neighbors became something like family—it all felt like evidence that we'd made the right choice. That we could build something new here, something better.

But the novelty of paradise began to sour like limes in an endless stream of vodka sodas.

What seemed like freedom at first quickly morphed into aimlessness. Without jobs to ground us, we drifted through our days untethered. The lack of structure we had once praised as liberating, celebrating it with great cheer, slowly became a weight that dragged us further down.

I'd find myself at 2 PM, still in my swimsuit from a morning swim, standing in the kitchen wondering if this was lunch or a very late breakfast. Time became elastic, meaningless. Days bled into each other with no distinction except the level of our hangovers. And yes, I can hear you from here—``What did you think was going to happen?''—Let's just say we weren't exactly big on foresight back then.

As a result, our drinking escalated. It was subtle at first—just sunset vodka sodas—a civilized nod to paradise living. We'd gather on terraces overlooking the ocean, raising glasses to another day successfully avoided. Then came the full-blown bar crawl of our lives, except the bar was our kitchen counter, and the only cover charge was our dignity.

Morning coffee became Irish coffee. Lunch beers multiplied like they were breeding. Evening cocktails bled into midnight mescal, which led to dawn negotiations with our bodies about why we'd done this to ourselves again.

Nights stretched into endless, blurred benders; mornings were swallowed by relentless hangovers. The days became indistinguishable, a haze of alcohol and apathy. The paradise we had envisioned slowly revealed its teeth, morphing into a gilded cage that neither of us could escape, destroying us faster than we cared to acknowledge.

The arguments that used to flare up occasionally now raged almost daily, volatility replacing the uneasy truce we once had. Arguments bloomed like weeds after a storm, choking out whatever fragile peace we had cultivated. It was no longer a competition to see who was right and instead became a screaming match to see who could yell loudest—usually me. Without the buffer of jobs, friends, or the steady hum of normal life, every raw emotion boiled to the surface. Each fight hit harder, burned hotter, leaving scars that didn't heal before the next eruption.

The smallest things became battlegrounds. Where to have dinner. Which beach to visit. Whether the fan should be on or off. We weren't really fighting about fans or restaurants—we were fighting about the growing distance between us, the way we'd become strangers sharing a bed, the fear that we'd made a terrible mistake we couldn't undo.

And yet, there were still those fleeting moments—moments when we'd lock eyes and it felt like the storm had passed, like there was still something worth fighting for. A shared laugh at something absurd. His hand finding mine during a particularly stunning sunset. The way we still knew each other's coffee order without asking. It was those rare flashes of calm that kept us holding on, convincing ourselves, however briefly, that we could make it work just a little longer.
